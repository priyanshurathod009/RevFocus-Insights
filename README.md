# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis - Power BI

## **Project Overview**
Atliq Grands, a prestigious chain of five-star hotels across India, has been a key player in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. However, recent strategic missteps and intense competition have resulted in a decline in their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment. To counter this, the management has decided to incorporate **Business and Data Intelligence** to regain their foothold in the market. Lacking an in-house data analytics team, Atliq Grands has engaged a third-party service provider to extract insights from their historical data.

### **Project Objectives**
- Develop a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI, using the provided sample data and mock-up dashboard.
- Create metrics as per the provided metric list.
- Generate additional insights beyond the specified metrics and mock-up dashboard to support decision-making.

## **Project Learnings**
- **Innovative Visuals**: 
  - Created a **Calendar visual** using a matrix table, enhancing the dashboardâ€™s analytical capabilities.
- **Cancellation Policies**: 
  - Gained insights into industry-standard cancellation policies, understanding that most hotels charge zero fees for cancellations made three months before the booking date. Cancellations made later incur fees ranging from 60% to 90% of the booking cost.
- **Bookmarks and Selections**: 
  - Utilized **bookmarks and selection tools** for effective page navigation and implementing clear filter buttons, improving user experience. (Inspired by a YouTube tutorial on website-like page navigation).
- **Consistent Design**: 
  - Applied a uniform **color palette** across the dashboard for a cohesive visual experience.
